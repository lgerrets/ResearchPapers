# ResearchPapers

I will try to update this repo with some of the research papers I have studied to keep track of them. Taking notes on paper is always nice too, but this repo should be more helpful in the long run!

[List](Summaries/README.md) of all papers I summarized.

## Methods

Points to look for in a paper (Reference : [Guide to Reading Academic Research Papers](https://towardsdatascience.com/guide-to-reading-academic-research-papers-c69c21619de6))
> 1. What previous research and ideas were cited that this paper is building off of? (this info tends to live in the introduction)
> 2. Was there reasoning for performing this research, if so what was it? (introduction section)
> 3. Clearly list out the objectives of the study
> 4. Was any equipment/software used? (methods section)
> 5. What variables were measured during experimentation? (methods)
> 6. Were any statistical tests used? What were their results? (methods/results section)
> 7. What are the main findings? (results section)
> 8. How do these results fit into the context of other research and their 'field'? (discussion section)
> 9. Explain each figure and discuss their significance.
> 10. Can the results be reproduced and is there any code available?
> 11. Name the authors, year, and title of the paper!
> 12. Are any of the authors familiar, do you know their previous work? 
> 13. What key terms and concepts do I not know and need to look up in a dictionary, textbook, or ask someone?
> 14. What are your thoughts on the results? Do they seem valid?
